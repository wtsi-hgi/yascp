abstract: >
  YASCP (Yet Another Single Cell Pipeline) is a reproducible, modular Nextflow pipeline 
  for processing single-cell RNA-seq data, including ambient RNA removal, donor deconvolution, 
  cell type assignment, clustering, and doublet detection. It was developed for large-scale 
  scRNA-seq analysis as part of the Cardinal project and is broadly applicable to single-cell 
  workflows. Version 1.9 introduces a unified container, simplified inputs, and configuration cleanup.
