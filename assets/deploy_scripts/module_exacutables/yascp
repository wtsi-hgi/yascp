This file should contain sanger_sample_id as a header and all the uniqie sanger sample ids in the folowin rows) will fetch the cellranger data and prepeare the basic yascp inputs. \n  	*yascp clean inputs.nf: will rsync results and extract symlinks from the folder defined as an 'outdir' and then remove work directory to avoid running out of quota (this will remove nextflow catche and pipeline will need to be rerun from beggining if needed)\n	*yascp input.nf :will run your samples as defined in input file.
