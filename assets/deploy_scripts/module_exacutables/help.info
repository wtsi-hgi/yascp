${bold}YASCP (Yet Another Single Cell Pieline)${normal}[https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp]
Nextflow pipeline that QCs the scRNA Cellranger data by removing ambient RNA, deconvoluting donors, assigning celltypes, analysing concordances vs expected genotypes
Please refear to the usage and outputs documentation here: https://hgi-projects.pages.internal.sanger.ac.uk/documentation/docs/tutorials/yascp_docs/#getting-started or here: https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/tree/78df9d94388045bc386ea32c2127abeb154a36c6

Yascp module has been set to run in multiple modes:
    ${bold}yascp -v${normal} :will describe the checkout tag used.
    ${bold}yascp test${normal} :will run a OneK1k test dataset.
    ${bold}yascp sample_input${normal} :will create a directory sample_input in your current working directory where you will sample input files.
    ${bold}yascp fetch ${normal}:(you need an input.tsv file [ap per this: https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/blob/main/sample_input/input.tsv] in project directory where you would like to fetch the cellranged data. This file should contain sanger_sample_id as a header and all the uniqie sanger sample ids in the folowin rows) will fetch the cellranger data and prepeare the basic yascp inputs. 
    ${bold}yascp clean -c inputs.nf${normal}: will rsync results and extract symlinks from the folder defined as an 'outdir' and then remove work directory to avoid running out of quota (this will remove nextflow catche and pipeline will need to be rerun from beggining if needed)
    ${bold}yascp -c input.nf${normal} :will run your samples as defined in input file. If you are unsure how to fill in the info file please refear to this documentation: https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/blob/main/docs/usage.md
    ${bold}yascp doublets -c input.nf${normal} : Run just doublet assesments on your h5ad/matrix files
    ${bold}yascp celltypes -c input.nf${normal} : Run just celltype assesments on your h5ad files
    ${bold}yascp clustering -c input.nf${normal} : Perform Integration with BBKNN, Harmony, Seurat
    ${bold}yascp cellbender -c input.nf${normal} : Run just cellbender ambient RNA removal.
