## Introduction

**nf-core/yascp** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for deconvolution, qc, clustering of a single cell datasets.
This is a large scale single-cell pipeline developed initially for processing Cardinal project samples, however it is applicable to any other scRNA analysis. The pipeline has been inspired by deconvolution (https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_scrna_deconvolution.git ), cellbender (https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_cellbender ) and qc (https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_qc_cluster/tree/main ) pipelines. Input requires a tsv seperated file with paths to the Cellranger 6.11 outputs (however we will shortly add a Cellranger module to make this pipeline more transferable) and if running in an genotype  additional input is required to be provided in an input.nf file pointing to the vcf location. This pipeline is designed to be used for multiple large scale single cell experiments.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->
<!-- On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/yascp/results). -->

## Documentation: Prepearing your own data and interpreting the results

The nf-core/yascp pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline [usage](https://nf-co.re/yascp/usage), [parameters](https://nf-co.re/yascp/parameters) and [output](https://nf-co.re/yascp/output). To understand how to prepeare your own data and how to interpret the results please refear to documents [HERE](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/tree/main/docs)

## Quick Start
Easyest to do is using a conda enviroment.

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.04.0`)
    ```console
    conda install nextflow=21.04.0
    ```

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download/clone the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    !NOTE: you need to define your institution specific queues in the conf/base.conf or provide aditional config file with -c flag in folowing comand such as: -c /path/to/yascp/conf/extra_confs/sanger/base.conf



    ```console
    nextflow run /path/to/colned/yascp -profile test_full,<docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
    ```

    !ALSO: by default this test dataset will run cellbender with a cpus - only performing 10 epochs. Cellbender is built for a gpu queue, so for the actual runs the deafault is to utilise_gpu = true
    You need to make sure that the gpu queue according to your institution is defined in confs: withLabel: gpu {} as for sanger [`config file`](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/blob/0fce7bd8ce4ca734e34b28443fe89630e295b1eb/conf/extra_confs/sanger/base.conf#L180-L194)

    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` then the pipeline will auto-detect this and attempt to download the Singularity images directly as opposed to performing a conversion from Docker images. If you are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues then please use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, it is highly recommended to use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to pre-download all of the required containers before running the pipeline and to set the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options to be able to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
