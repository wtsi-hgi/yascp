**YASCP** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline designed for high-quality deconvolution, scRNA data quality control, doublet detection, cell type assignment, clustering, and integration of single-cell datasets. YASCP stands for "Yet Another Single Cell Pipeline." The sequence from Y to A in the acronym, referring to the alphabet, symbolizes the continuous journey of learning and discovery, with no Z to represent the ultimate knowledge that remains just out of reach, motivating us to keep exploring.

|-----------------|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Pool1 |   1      | ""            | path/to/cellranger/10x_folder      |
| Pool2|   2      | ""        | path/to/cellranger/10x_folder      |

Results will demultiplex individuals, robustly assess the assignments

As well as assign celltypes, perform integrations, remove ambient RNA and produce publication ready plots

Developed under the leadership of N.Soranzo and Human Genetics Informatics (HGI), this large-scale single-cell pipeline was originally crafted for the Cardinal project (profiling UKBB and ELGH participants) but is versatile enough for broad scRNA analysis applications. 

Input requires a tsv seperated file [(please read detailed documentation here)](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/tree/yascp_docs) with paths and if running in an genotype  additional input is required to be provided in an input.nf file pointing to the vcf location. This pipeline is designed to be used any large scale single cell experiments.

The foundational ideas were inspired by earlier pipelines from Anderson lab but has been expanded, specifically those for [deconvolution](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_scrna_deconvolution.git), [cellbender](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_cellbender), and [quality control and clustering](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/nf_qc_cluster/tree/main). This ensures a robust integration of proven methodologies tailored to meet the demands of expansive single-cell data analysis.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->
<!-- On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/yascp/results). -->

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.04.0`)
2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/)for full pipeline reproducibility.
3. Download/clone the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp.git
    nextflow run /path/to/colned/yascp -profile test,<docker/singularity,institute>
    ```

## Run on your own data

1. Prepeare input.tsv file:
   
| experiment_id   | n_pooled | donor_vcf_ids    |  data_path_10x_format   |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Pool1 |   1      | ""            | path/to/cellranger/10x_folder      |
| Pool2|   2      | ""        | path/to/cellranger/10x_folder      |

2. Run on your data
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp.git
    nextflow run /path/to/colned/yascp -profile test,<docker/singularity,institute> --input_data_table input.tsv
    ```

<!-- TODO nf-core: If applicable, make list of people who have also contributed -->

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

## Contributions and Support
